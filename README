This predictor program can predict the value of functions with two variables. 
First of all we need to train program with examples.(in this case examples.csv)
For example suppose we try to predict price of house against two paramters of house(e.g number of room and area).
Firstly we train program with some known examples. After that we provide program with new paramaters(features of house)
and the program tell us the appropriate price of house with given features.

To use program:
  - change examples.csv according to your demand
  - run main.rb to predict
